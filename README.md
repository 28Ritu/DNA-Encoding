# DNA-Encoding

### Course: Introduction To Quantitative Biology

#### Objective:
      1. To get the DNA sequences of one strand of 2 different DNA molecules.
      2. Encode the DNA sequences to binary format and also calculate their respective total bonding energy.
      3. Print the DNA molecule that will melt at higher temperature by comparing the no. of G-C base pairs in each DNA molecule.
